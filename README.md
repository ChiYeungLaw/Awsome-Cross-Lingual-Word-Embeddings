# Awsome Cross Lingual Word Embeddings

This repo contains some Cross-lingual word embeddings research. I summarize some papers and categorize them by myself. You are kindly invited to pull requests!

This survey [A survey of cross-lingual word embedding models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04902) has good coverage of this area.
